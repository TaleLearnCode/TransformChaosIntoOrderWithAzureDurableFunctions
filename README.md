## Elevator Pitch

Unlock the power of Azure Durable Functions for .NET! Learn to orchestrate scalable, resilient serverless workflows with ease.

## Short Abstract

In cloud computing, serverless architecture is celebrated for its scalability and cost-efficiency. Yet, orchestrating complex workflows can be challenging. Azure Durable Functions simplify workflow orchestration in .NET environments. This session explores function chaining, fan-out/fan-in, async HTTP APIs, and more. Learn best practices, optimize serverless apps, and build efficient workflows without managing infrastructure. It is ideal for both seasoned and new developers.

## Abstract
Durable Functions is an open-source extension to Azure Functions designed to enable long-running orchestrations and stateful processes as serverless functions. In this session, learn about the common use patterns for Durable Functions, discover how to implement them step-by-step, and explore best practices for writing both simple and complex stateful orchestrations. Gain practical insights into enhancing your cloud solutions, ensuring efficiency, scalability, and reliability in your applications. Perfect for developers and IT professionals seeking to leverage Azure's powerful capabilities for stateful serverless architectures.
